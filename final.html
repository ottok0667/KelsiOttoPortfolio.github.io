		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>For our final project, we were allowed to choose to either create a program using Scratch or by coding in Python. 
		I chose to create a game in the latter. First, we had to write a written description that outlined the overall game, 
		the objects it would include, and the gameplay and flow of the program. I decided to create an archery game. The first 
		screen to be displayed would be the instruction screen, from which the user could choose a level to begin playing at. 
		Additionally, this screen outlined the instructions. Once the user began the game, had to use the crosshairs, a little 
		plus sign, to target. To shoot, they would press the spacebar. The points awarded to the user would depend on where the 
		marker, an object representing where the arrow would have gone, landed. For example, if the user missed the target 
		entirely, they would earn zero points, but they would earn ten if they hit the very center of the target. Three variable 
		were displayed on each level: the number of arrows remaining, the level, and the score. At every level, the score would be 
		reset to zero, and the number of arrows would be reset to five. In order to proceed to the next level, the user needed to 
		earn at least 20 points, and they had five arrows to shoot. In the first level, the target remained stationary. However, 
		in level two, it moved slowly horizontally. In level three, it moved the same speed up and down. In the fourth and fifth 
		levels, though the speed remained the same, the target moved in all directions randomly. In Level 3, a cat was introduced, 
		and it walked back and forth across the bottom of the screen. At Level 4, a dragon was displayed for the first time, and it 
		moved in a square in the top half of the screen. If the user hit either creature, the game would be over. 
			</p>
		<p>In order to earn an A, it was necessary to include multiple lists. I used one of these lists to store images of the dragon 
		present in Levels 4 and 5. These would be flipped through to give the illusion that the dragon was flapping its wings, and 
		changing direction. I used another list to store images of the cat moving to the left and right, and yet another to store the 
		background images. In the runner file, I called the costume variable to change the background depending on the level number 
		input at the introductory screen. Additionally, variables, methods, conditional statements, user interaction, and a graphical 
		interface were required by the rubric. Five class files were also necessary in order to earn full credit, as well as five 
		different levels or main scenes.

		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Loops - understanding the further use of for loops, especially understanding that in a given program, only one for loop, 
			excluding nested for loops, should be used
				</li>
			<li>Accessibility - understanding how to download python and pygame, and therefore how to access and edit files, including 
			transferring files from computer to computer via Google Drive
				</li>
			<li>Lists - having a greater familiarity with using lists, especially understanding how they are helpful, including being 
			able to change the value of the costume variable from the runner file
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to appropriately create and call variables in order to improve a program, especially in 
			creating variables to use in conditional statements
				</li>
			<li>Outputs - understanding how to determine the output of a given program, especially those including lists, loops, nested 
			loops, and conditionals
				</li>
		</ul>
