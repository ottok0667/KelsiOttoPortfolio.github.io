		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fenced-In</li>
			<li>Nets</li>
			<li>Diamonds</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use Jeroo to design a repeating code allowing a Jeroo to move diagonally between two rows of fences. For extra credit, I had the Jeroo toss a flower to destroy the last net constraining the Jeroo, allowing it to escape confinement. Next, I had to use the program to move my Jeroo horizontally across the island, picking flowers and destroying nets in the process. To do this, I had to use a few pre-existing methods. Lastly, I had to instruct a Jeroo to plant flowers in a diamond shape across the island, taking into account the number of flowers needed and the location the Jeroo needed to begin at. In order to be successful, I had to repeat the same code over many times, reorient my Jeroo, and repeat the same code. Later, this repeated code was placed under the Jeroo Methods Tab.  
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Instantiation - creating and naming (a) Jeroo(s) in a certain location, facing the appropriate direction and with a certain number of flowers
				</li>
			<li>Basic command methods - moving the Jeroo using the hop() method, and picking and tossing flowers with the pick() and toss() methods
				</li>
			<li>Basic understanding - how to open the Jeroo program (including downloading and opening island and general code files) and run the given code
				</li>
			<li>Methods - creating and calling a method to refrain from typing the same piece of code repeatedly
				</li>
			<li>Multiple Jeroos - place each Jeroo in a useful area so each can perform the same method but save lines of code instructing the Jeroo to turn
				</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Boxes</li>
			<li>Flowers</li>
			<li>LED</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Escape</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use Jeroo to plant flowers at each corner of a square by creating a single method to call in the main method. Then, I had to create another method to plant flowers along a single side of the island. I would call this method four times, between which I would instruct my Jeroo to turn so it would not end up in the water. Next, I made several different methods for my Jeroo to plant flowers in the shape of the numbers 0 through 9. In many of these methods, I was able to refer to previous methods that had similar shapes. After creating these methods, I had to call only the three numbers that corresponded to the last three digits of my phone number. In another lab, I had to create a method to plant flowers on a single side of a square water pool, which I would call in order to form a boundary around the entire square. Lastly, I had to create a single method to allow four Jeroos to navigate through a maze and result near each corner of the island. Each Jeroo began with a single flower.
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Methods - further understanding and use of creating and calling methods to reduce code length when performing the same action
				</li>
			<li>Further program usage - how to create an island file, including placing flowers, nets, and water on the island
				</li>
			<li>Positioning - turning the Jeroo in a particular direction in order to appropriately fulfill a task and refrain from ending up in the water
				</li>
			<li>Basic debugging - determining possible reasons for the incorrect movement of a Jeroo, and fixing small errors in typing the code, such as leaving out a semicolon, or the name of the Jeroo
				</li>
			<li>Calling - calling a particular method within another method under the Jeroo Methods tab before calling them under the Main Method tab
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Flowers2</li>
			<li>Pinball</li>
			<li>Spiral</li>
			<li>Water</li>
			<li>Lockup</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>First, I had to create a method that once more instructed a Jeroo to plant flowers around the perimeter of the island. However, this time, instead of the method containing code telling the Jeroo exactly the number of steps to hop or flowers to plant, I had to incorporate a loop. Next, I had to create two methods to instruct a single Jeroo to pick up all the flowers planted on an island. Then, I had to create a single method instructing the Jeroo to spiral through a network of nets, and spiral back out for extra credit. In the next lab, I had to create a method for a single Jeroo or multiple Jeroos to place flowers around multiple different water pools. For the last lab, I had to instruct a single Jeroo to clear the flower-and-net-square-fence surrounding the other three Jeroos in order to allow all four to “flee to the east.”
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Loops - understanding that while loops code for an action to continue until the condition is false, and knowing how and when to incorporate the concept in Jeroo
				</li>
			<li>Boolean Methods - being familiar with the uses and how to include the different conditionals in Jeroo, such as: isNet(), isFlower, isWater(), isFacing(), and isClear()
				</li>
			<li>Boolean Operators - understanding and being familiar with the usage of the various operators signifying “and”, “not”, and “or” (&&, !, and | |)
				</li>
			<li>Multiple Jeroos - understanding how multiple Jeroos can be used to accomplish a task when each calls the same method, allowing one to refrain from having to code a single Jeroo to turn and move to a specific location
				</li>
			<li>Logical Thinking - using the provided elements on the island to the greatest advantage, such as directing the Jeroo when to turn or move in a certain direction based upon the location of the water, nets, and flowers
				</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>
		
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Spiral</li>
			<li>Alley Run</li>
			<li>Chaos</li>
			<li>Recursive Box</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>For the first lab, I had to instruct a Jeroo to spiral into and out of a maze using ‘if’ statements. For extra credit, I navigated my Jeroo using recursion. In the next lab, using if and else statements, I had to navigate my Jeroo from the left to right side of the island. On the way, my Jeroo had to pick all the flowers, replace every net with a flower, and plant a flower opposite water. Then, I had to navigate my Jeroo around an island cluttered with nets, flowers, and water using several ‘if’ and ‘else’ statements. Finally, I had to instruct the Jeroo to plant around the perimeter of the island once more, except this time using recursion.
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Loops - understanding the difference in usage of the ‘while’ loop and conditionals ‘if’,  and ’if-else’; being able to incorporate each appropriately in the Jeroo programs
				</li>
			<li>Recursion - calling a Jeroo Method under its same method within a conditional to repeat the same method if it is true
				</li>
			<li>Program End - understanding how to specify the conditional statements so the Jeroo program does not continue indefinitely or end up in the water, a net, or in another inappropriate location
				</li>
			<li>Conditionals - using ‘if’ and ‘if-else’ statements to instruct a particular Jeroo of particular routines to perform when a single condition is true
				</li>
			<li>Organization - being able to combine different loops and ‘if’ statements within a single Jeroo function to more efficiently perform a task, as opposed to typing each line of code and directly instructing the Jeroo
				</li>
		</ul>
