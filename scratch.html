		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use Scratch to design and create a program to display my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter and program them to perform a total of 3 unique behaviors. When the green flag was clicked, the program needed to run, and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene to the beginning each time the spacebar was pressed. 
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Using event blocks - when the green flag was clicked, the sprites would move, and when the spacebar was pressed, the scene returned to its original appearance (sprites returned to their initial size and position)
				</li>
			<li>Conditional statements - used ‘if’ statements to return the octopus sprite to its original location when its x position reached a certain value
				</li>
			<li>Used loops - used a forever block to operate the movement of the octopus, and a repeat until block to instruct Scratch to decrease the size of the ‘K’ and ‘I’ sprites ten times
				</li>
			<li>Sprites - used the library of sprites to create the letters in my name, then adjusted their color and size
				</li>
			<li>Movement - used the x and y values to make my sprites return to their original locations when the spacebar was pressed, and I rotated the sprites to add another behavior to my sprites
				</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use Scratch to design a program to display the choices available to someone buying a computer. The requirements were to describe the scenario and the requirements specified by the buyer, and show four options available that fit the requirements best. Additionally, I had to compare the unique features of each device, and determine the computer that best fit the requirements and explain why.
			</p>
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sprites - when different keys were pressed, some sprites would disappear, reappear, or switch costumes
				</li>
			<li>Background screens - when the appropriate keys were pressed, the background would change
				</li>
			<li>Uploading images to Scratch - I uploaded pictures of the different computer options as sprites to display
				</li>
			<li>Detective loops - used a loop to tell the program to change backgrounds when the mouse was pressed over the appropriate place on the screen
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Final Project</h2>

		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Use Scratch to design a multi-leveled game with time and score variable(s). The requirements also specified the need for a direction screen, and a definite end to the game where all sprites remained in a fixed position. Furthermore, it needed to be clear to the user if they won. Pressing the green flag had to restart the game.
			</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Variables - created a timer to limit the time the user was allowed to play on a certain level, and a score variable to keep score
				</li>
			<li>Sound - when the finish screen is displayed, I showed a bell tolling and had a connected sound play
				</li>
			<li>Control blocks - I used the ‘stop this script’ blocks, instructing the program to ignore a particular piece of code when a specific key was pressed
				</li>
			<li>Pen blocks - when the green flag is pressed, circles begin drawing themselves, though the pen shade gradually changes
				</li>
		</ul>
