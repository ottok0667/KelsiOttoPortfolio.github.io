		<h2>Unit 0</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Intro</li>
			<li>Lab 1</li>
			<li>Lab 2</li>
			<li>Input</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>In the first lab, we programmed general print statements, including those involving numerical values and their operations. In the next lab, we were to implement the print statements to create a sort of table involving a pattern of addition and equal signs. After that, we were to create another box through further use of print statements, involving spacing. However, in the last lab, we were to assign and implement variables in order to allow for user input. In this case, we created two variables for each of the following: integers, doubles, floats and shorts. The program would tell the user to input values, and would return the output. For extra credit, I created two more variables, one to display the sum of the two integers, the other to display the sum of the two doubles.

		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessibility - opening and copying files, including creating projects, packages, as well as class files, and appropriately naming them
				</li>
			<li>Syntax - understanding that, with some exceptions, a semicolon must always be placed at the end of a line of code, and that an open curly brace must follow every method, and that a close curly brace must follow that
				</li>
			<li>Errors - understanding how to determine the cause of, and correct any errors that occur, especially related to missing or extra curly braces, and the incorrect labeling of packages
				</li>
			<li>Text - understanding how to print text, including knowing that \t represents a tab and that \n represents a new line
				</li>
			<li>Numerical Values - understanding that numerical values can be written within print statements, especially that multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction can be done within them, all without the use of quotes
				</li>
			<li>Variables - having a vague understanding of how to assign variables, and use them with the combination of print statements to allow for user input
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Choose Your Own Adventure</h2>
		<h2>Elements:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Decision Tree</li>
			<li>Actual Program</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>In the “Create Your Own Adventure” assignment, we were to incorporate all our knowledge of Java into a cumulative project through the use of conditionals. Before we began coding, we created a decision tree of possible choices a user could make. The point was to create a story of a sort that would begin by asking the user where they would like to go: either to place a or place b. After that, another two choices would be available to them. At least four choices were required before the user received their fate. Some of these endings were to be good, while others were supposed to be more negative, or bad altogether. To check for user input, the following piece of code: Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in), was used to compare what the user input to the two allowed inputs. 
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Conditionals - understanding how to create if and else-if statements, and use them appropriately, including understanding that an open and closed curly brace must follow each
				</li>
			<li>Outputs - understanding how to determine the output of a particular conditional statement, including understanding that some may result in errors or no answer at all
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to define and use variables, especially in combination with the Scanner keyboard code to define a user input
				</li>
			<li>Organization - understanding how to assign multiple of the same type of variables on the same line, without creating definitive values for them, as well as using comments and line spacing to separate chunks of code
				</li>
			<li>Inputs - understanding how to use a string variable to define and search for the next word or line of words input by the user, and differentiate between the possible inputs to display a particular textual statement or result in an error caused by an incorrect input, also in correspondence with the Scanner keyboard code
				</li>
		</ul>
