	<h3>Why I Like the Movie</h3>
	<p>I like this movie because the words the characters say are often funny and the plot line is entertaining. Furthermore, it is interesting to see how the director of the movie pictured the characters and how that affects how the different characters appear. Also, the special effects, such as spells cast from wands, and the other creatures featured in the piece are interesting.</p>
	<h3>Favorite Actor</h3>
	<p>My favorite actor in this movie is Emma Watson. She is one of the main characters in the piece, and plays her role well, making her part both entertaining at times, but serious at others.</p>
