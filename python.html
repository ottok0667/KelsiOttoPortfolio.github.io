		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Variables</li>
			<li>Math Tricks</li>
			<li>Moving</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Write a program that allows for the input of values by the user and prints the resulting statement. One program was responsible for gathering the user’s name and age, while the other took in a decimal value and two integers. This program determined what the remainder of each value was, found the product of the two integers, and the product of all the values. In the next lab, I had to program two different math tricks, each of which within their own method. Similarly to the previous lab, this code required user input to determine the value, perform a set of calculations, and give the result. Each trick was to result in the same answer, despite the different inputs. In the final lab, we used Pygame to display an image of a figure, which we were to move around with the arrow keys. However, using conditionals, we were to keep the character from leaving the screen.
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessibility - opening and naming files appropriately, including adding the .py to each file name to allow for the color coding of the code
				</li>
			<li>Classes - creating and filling in a class, such as adding methods for movement and creating a constructor with parameters for the x and y values, and self
				</li>
			<li>Imports - generally understanding that class files can be imported to incorporate and use an object in a larger program
				</li>
			<li>Pygame Grid - understanding that the y values in Pygame, unlike on a normal coordinate grid, increase as you go down, and that the upper left hand corner represents the the coordinate (0, 0)
				</li>
			<li>Object Positioning - understanding that the x value of an object is at the left edge of the object, and the y value is at the top edge of the same object, thus causing the top left corner to represent the coordinate (x, y)
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to create and perform calculations with values input by the user, or present in the code, and how to print their result
				</li>
			<li>Conditionals  - understanding how to form else, else-if, and if statements, including the use of “or” and “and”, especially recognizing the need for proper syntax, such as appropriate indentation and the use of a colon
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't Walk Off</li>
			<li>Collide</li>
			<li>Running Man</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Write another program to display the character object in Pygame, and prevent it from being able to leave the screen. However, unlike in the previous lab, we had to call the methods instructing the object to move, while in the previous lab, they were already called. The next lab simply built upon this by incorporating collision. This was accomplished by comparing the x and y values, and the width and height of a wall object with the respective values of the guy object. Conditionals were used to detect the actual collision by determining whether the guy was to the left or right of the wall, or above or below the object. If it was not, the guy was colliding with the object. In the final lab, collision was taken a step further, into a game format. I was instructed to create a program to allow the guy to hop over the wall object. This obstacle would be moving, and each time the character avoided it, the score would increase by one. However, if the two collided, the game ended. An extension to this program was to create two other objects, one of which would decrease the score when it collided with the guy object. The other would increase the score if touched by the player. 
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Objects - using images to create objects, as well as learning how to import added classes to the runner files in the following format: from file import *
				</li>
			<li>Object Positioning - understanding that collision is a result of the sides or corners of objects colliding, especially understanding that since the upper left corner is (x, y), the upper right corner is (x + width, y), the lower left corner is (x, y + height), and the lower right corner is (x + width, y + height)
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to change the values of certain variables through the use of various conditionals, and using their values to determine other occurrences
				</li>
			<li>Movement - how to use variables for speed and the x coordinates of objects to allow them to move, and gradually increase their speed through the use of conditionals
				</li>
			<li>Conditionals - determining the output of if, else, and else-if statements in a program given context
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Unit 3</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Timer</li>
			<li>Caesar Cipher</li>
			<li>Squares and Circles</li>
			<li>Tiles</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>In the first lab, a loop was made to create a timer to count down the number of seconds and minutes remaining after the user input the seconds value. In the next lab, Caesar Cipher was used to encode a particular phrase. In this scenario, we were to shift the alphabet by up to three letters, through the use of a loop. Then, a loop was made to draw a line of squares, in which each consecutive shape was to shrink by ten pixels. After creating the squares, another loop was used to draw a set of shrinking circles, though while the circle radius decreased, the color shade was to darken. Lastly, a nested loop was used to create a grassy background by displaying a single grass tile in pygame at a time. Once the grass was drawn, another loop was used to randomly position thirty rocks on the screen. 
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Loops - understanding how to create and use loops to perform specific functions, including determining the output of a particular loop statement
				</li>
			<li>Positioning - understanding how to program a certain object to be drawn at a random x and y coordinate, and how to set and create variables accordingly
				</li>
			<li>Encryption - understanding that Caesar Cipher is used to encode messages, and knowing how to use it generally to create and decipher a  code
				</li>
			<li>Timer - understanding how to create and display a time limit that decreases by the second, without displaying partial seconds
				</li>
			<li>Sizing - understanding how to create variables using a loop that will decrease the value in question each time the loop runs
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Unit 4</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Costume Changing</li>
			<li>Ground Changing</li>
			<li>Dodging Enemies</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>In the first lab, a program was made to display the appropriate image on the screen when the user pressed the corresponding arrow keys. Under each method (up, down, left, right), the variable representing the parameter in the list would be reset, and the appropriate image would be displayed. In the next lab, a list was used to load four different ground images. Then, a nested loop and conditionals were used to draw a road with the appropriate tiles. In the last lab,  the ground created in the previous lab was used to create a game in which aliens were displayed on a screen. The guy had to cross the road and avoid the enemies moving across it. A list was used to determine whether or not all the aliens were on the screen, and if they were not, another would appear with its own x and y coordinates and speed. 
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Objects - understanding how to use lists to change the image displayed when an object turns in a particular direction to enhance the program
				</li>
			<li>Lists - understanding how to use lists, including the basic understanding of printing, and changing the values they contain
				</li>
			<li>Tuples - understanding the differences between lists and tuples, especially that tuples cannot be changed, and that their values are static
				</li>
			<li>Arrays - understanding that indices indicate the value that is being accessed in a list, and that they begin at the value 0
				</li>
			<li>Positioning - understanding what x and y coordinates to specify in a program in order to arrange tiles in the appropriate format
				</li>
		</ul>
