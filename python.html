		<h2>Unit 1</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Variables</li>
			<li>Math Tricks</li>
			<li>Moving</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Write a program that allows for the input of values by the user and prints the resulting statement. One program was responsible for gathering the user’s name and age, while the other took in a decimal value and two integers. This program determined what the remainder of each value was, found the product of the two integers, and the product of all the values. In the next lab, I had to program two different math tricks, each of which within their own method. Similarly to the previous lab, this code required user input to determine the value, perform a set of calculations, and give the result. Each trick was to result in the same answer, despite the different inputs. In the final lab, we used Pygame to display an image of a figure, which we were to move around with the arrow keys. However, using conditionals, we were to keep the character from leaving the screen.
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Accessibility - opening and naming files appropriately, including adding the .py to each file name to allow for the color coding of the code
				</li>
			<li>Classes - creating and filling in a class, such as adding methods for movement and creating a constructor with parameters for the x and y values, and self
				</li>
			<li>Imports - generally understanding that class files can be imported to incorporate and use an object in a larger program
				</li>
			<li>Pygame Grid - understanding that the y values in Pygame, unlike on a normal coordinate grid, increase as you go down, and that the upper left hand corner represents the the coordinate (0, 0)
				</li>
			<li>Object Positioning - understanding that the x value of an object is at the left edge of the object, and the y value is at the top edge of the same object, thus causing the top left corner to represent the coordinate (x, y)
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to create and perform calculations with values input by the user, or present in the code, and how to print their result
				</li>
			<li>Conditionals  - understanding how to form else, else-if, and if statements, including the use of “or” and “and”, especially recognizing the need for proper syntax, such as appropriate indentation and the use of a colon
				</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Unit 2</h2>
		<h2>Labs:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't Walk Off</li>
			<li>Collide</li>
			<li>Running Man</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Write another program to display the character object in Pygame, and prevent it from being able to leave the screen. However, unlike in the previous lab, we had to call the methods instructing the object to move, while in the previous lab, they were already called. The next lab simply built upon this by incorporating collision. This was accomplished by comparing the x and y values, and the width and height of a wall object with the respective values of the guy object. Conditionals were used to detect the actual collision by determining whether the guy was to the left or right of the wall, or above or below the object. If it was not, the guy was colliding with the object. In the final lab, collision was taken a step further, into a game format. I was instructed to create a program to allow the guy to hop over the wall object. This obstacle would be moving, and each time the character avoided it, the score would increase by one. However, if the two collided, the game ended. An extension to this program was to create two other objects, one of which would decrease the score when it collided with the guy object. The other would increase the score if touched by the player. 
			</p>
		
		<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Objects - using images to create objects, as well as learning how to import added classes to the runner files in the following format: from file import *
				</li>
			<li>Object Positioning - understanding that collision is a result of the sides or corners of objects colliding, especially understanding that since the upper left corner is (x, y), the upper right corner is (x + width, y), the lower left corner is (x, y + height), and the lower right corner is (x + width, y + height)
				</li>
			<li>Variables - understanding how to change the values of certain variables through the use of various conditionals, and using their values to determine other occurrences
				</li>
			<li>Movement - how to use variables for speed and the x coordinates of objects to allow them to move, and gradually increase their speed through the use of conditionals
				</li>
			<li>Conditionals - determining the output of if, else, and else-if statements in a program given context
				</li>
		</ul>
